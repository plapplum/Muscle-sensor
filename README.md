!!!PLEASE READ BEFORE PRINT!!!

The sensor enclosure design is currently at version 1.3
Please read through the printer preset before print and make sure your printer is in peak condition
The filament I used is PLA but ABS and PETG will also do the job. This Git only contain STEP and STL file.
The code and circuit diagram is not provided by me.
Make sure the print orientation is according to the provided slice file, this design requires zero support
for ease of printing.
